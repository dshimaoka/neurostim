# What is Neurostim? 
Neurostim is software to create experiments in (visual) neuroscience. It allows users to design and/or implement visual stimuli, feedback conditions, eye tracking systems and more.  The software harnesses the functions available in Psychtoolbox and packages them into reusable, modular classes. In this way, new experiments can be quickly assembled by instantiating pre-existing classes from the Neurostim library. 

# Why should I use Neurostim? 
Rather than create independent scripts for every new experiment – a time consuming process – Neurostim enables users to build their experiments from pre-existing, re-usable and tested components. This accelerates the software development phase and allows users to focus on what matters most, the actual experimentation.
