function c= diodeTimingTester(device)
% Experiment that tests timing reliability between Matlab and a separate data
% acquisition system, using a photodiode.
%
% Currently implemented for EGI and Starstim
%
% INPUT
% device = 'EGI' or 'STARSTIM'
%
%% EGI Specifics
% Hardware:
%  Connect the DIN output of the EGI AV Tester to the DIN port on the
%  NetAmp (second from the top, labeled Din 1-8)
%  Connect photodiode to AV tester
%  Position the photodiode in the top left corner of the subject monitor
%
% NetStation Acquisition:
%   In Hardware Settings, in DIN 1-8, select 'Din 1'
%
% NSPTB:
%   Start this experiment. The 'subject' will be the computer that this is
%   run on. A Neurostim data file will be generated, but it is not needed
%   in the analysis (yet).
%
% NetStation:
%   While the experiment runs, you should see the event markers at the top
%   of the data display (GRAT, DIN1, plus other flags showing the start of
%   the trial, end of the trial etc.)
%
%   Once the experiment finishes, open the NetStation MFF output file that
%   was generated with the 'Event Timing Tester' application (in EGI Utils
%   directory).
%   From the drop-down menus in the Event Timing Tester:
%       Choose 'Stim Event Code' =  'GRAT' (the name
%       of the gabor stimulus that generates the visual stimulus and the
%       software events)
%       Chose "DIN Event Code' = 'DIN1'  (the source of the photodiode
%       detection pulses)
%   Then press Create Timing Table.
%
%   The relevant numbers to look at are the average, maximum, and minium
%   offsets in the lower left window. A constant offset is fine (and should be
%   used in the analysis to correct alignment;see below), but variance should be
%   minimal. Typically, events are logged with less than 2 ms variation.
%
%   Positive offsets means the diode detected the event later than the
%   software logged the event.
%
% Notes.
%
% EGI's Timing Tester's offset is the difference between DIN1 time and GRAT
% time.
% The time that is passed to NetStation is the time on the high-precision
% Matlab clock that the screen was flipped to show the grating. So, if PTB
% is working correctly (no frame synchronization errors/frame drops), this
% is the precise moment when the top left of the screen becomes white,
% which is detected with ~0 delay by the photodiode and timed by Netstation
% as the DIN1 event.
%
% There is no reason why the Matlab clock (o.cic.clockTime) and the
% Netstation clock would have the same origin. So the difference between
% them simply quantifies this difference in origin. Once we know the delay
% we can adjust the TCP timing clock on Netstation to correct it. You do this
% by entereing the mean offset from the Timing Tester as the
% egi.clockOffset parameter.
%
% So run this script once with 100 trials to estimate the offset(using Timing Tester) and
% then enter the mean timing tester offset as the e.clockOffset parameter
% below and then run it for a 1000 trials to confirm that the offset in
% Timing Tester is (close to) zero.

%% Setup for timing test using a photo diode
% To test onset timing, we use a diodeFlasher 
% It presents a small white square in the top left corner
% of the screen that turns on/off with the target stimulus 
% On a generic monitor color should be [r g b].
% Size is specified as a fraction of the horizontal number of pixels in the monitor
addDiodeFlasher(g,'location','nw','onColor',[1 1 1],'offColor',[0 0 0],'size',0.01)


%% Setup data acquisition device

        %% Setup the EGI Plugin
        e = plugins.egi(c); % Add the EGI plugin
        % On your first run, set this to 0 to measure the delay between photodiode
        % and the TCP generated GRAT event
        e.clockOffset = 0;  % In KLab rig this is 13.5 ms.
        % If you have Netstation 3.5 or later and a NetAMP 400 or later then use
        % NTPSync mode - it is the most reliable way to keep Matlab and EGI clocks
        % synchronized.
        e.useNTPSync = true;
        e.syncEveryN = 0;  % NTP synchronization is only done once
        %If you have an older version or NTP does not work, you can try this:
        %e.useNTPSync =false; %
        %e.syncEveryN = 25; % In every 25th inter trial interval the EGI TCP clock
        % will be adjusted so that we're in sync again. You can
        % try running this as Inf, and run ~150 trials to see
        % how often you should sync (Look through the dealys in
        % the output of the EGI Timing Tester program to see
        % how fast the clock drifts.
        % You may receive a message that NetStation synchronization did not succceed within 2.5ms
        % and that synchronization accuracy is something larger. I dont understand
        %  the logic behind that message:  the code in Netstation tests how
        % long it takes to deliver an event to NetStation. If that is more than 2.5
        % ms it complains about lack of synchronization. But this is incorrect: the
        % mean event delivery time does not matter for synchronization. It is the
        % consistency that matters, but that is not computed. Unless you have a
        % very busy network this method should work fine. (And you can confirm by
        % looking at the TimingTester results). But for this non-NTP sync, repeated
        % synchronization is necessary every 25 trials or so.
